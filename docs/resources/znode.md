# zookeeper_znode (Resource)

Manages the lifecycle of a [ZooKeeper ZNode](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes). This resource manages **Persistent ZNodes**. The data can be provided either as UTF-8 string, or as Base64 encoded bytes. The ability to create ZNodes is determined by ZooKeeper ACL.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# UTF-8 encoded content
resource "zookeeper_znode" "napoli" {
  path = "/forza/napoli"
  data = "Sempre!"
}

# Base64 encoded content
resource "zookeeper_znode" "napoli_logo" {
  path        = "/forza/napoli/logo"
  data_base64 = filebase64("logo.png")
}
```
