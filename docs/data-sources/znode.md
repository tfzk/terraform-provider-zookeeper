# zookeeper_znode (Data Source)

Provides access to the content of a [ZooKeeper ZNode](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes). The data is loaded both as UTF-8 string, as well as Base64 encoded bytes. The ability to access ZNodes is determined by ZooKeeper ACL.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "zookeeper_znode" "best_team" {
  path = "/serie/a/best_team"
  data = "It's SSC Napoli, of course!"
}

data "zookeeper_znode" "best_team" {
  path = zookeeper_znode.best_team.path
}

output "best_team_znode_path" {
  value = data.zookeeper_znode.best_team.path
}

output "best_team_znode_data" {
  value = data.zookeeper_znode.best_team.data
}

output "best_team_znode_data_base64" {
  value = data.zookeeper_znode.best_team.data_base64
}
```

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `stat` (List of Object) [ZooKeeper Stat Structure](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkStatStructure) of the ZNode. More details about `stat` can be found [here](../../docs#the-stat-structure). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stat))
