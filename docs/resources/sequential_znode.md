# zookeeper_sequential_znode (Resource)

Manages the lifecycle of a [ZooKeeper ZNode](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes). This resource manages **Persistent Sequential ZNodes**. The data can be provided either as UTF-8 string, or as Base64 encoded bytes. The ability to create ZNodes is determined by ZooKeeper ACL.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Creating 3 sequential nodes in the same "directory".
# Nodes will have final `.path` of:
#
#  /sequential/nodes/go/in/here/0000000001
#  /sequential/nodes/go/in/here/0000000002
#  /sequential/nodes/go/in/here/0000000003
#
# NOTE: the order they appear in the config (i.e. `seqA`,
# `seqB`, `seqC`) does NOT guarantee they will be
# respectively named `0000000001`, `0000000002`, `0000000003`.
#
# Their creation is parallelized by Terraform,
# so ZooKeeper will give each a unique name,
# but not necessarily in the order we see here.
#
# Consider using `depends_on`
# (https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/depends_on)
# if you want to impose a specific creation order,
# OR consider using `zookeeper_znode`s instead.

resource "zookeeper_znode" "dir" {
  path = "/sequential/nodes/go/in/here"
}

resource "zookeeper_sequential_znode" "seqA" {
  path_prefix = zookeeper_znode.dir.path + "/"
  data        = "some data"
}

resource "zookeeper_sequential_znode" "seqB" {
  path_prefix = zookeeper_znode.dir.path + "/"
  data        = "some more data"
}

resource "zookeeper_sequential_znode" "seqC" {
  path_prefix = zookeeper_znode.dir.path + "/"
  data        = "even more data"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `path_prefix` (String) Absolute path to the Sequential ZNode to create. ZooKeeper will append a monotonically increasing counter to the end of path. This counter is unique to the parent znode, and its format is `%010d` (10 digits with `0` padding).For example, the first sequential node created with a given `path_prefix` will be: `<path-prefix>0000000001`.

### Optional

- `acl` (Block List) List of ACL entries for the ZNode. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--acl))
- `data` (String) Content to store in the ZNode, as a UTF-8 string. Mutually exclusive with `data_base64`.
- `data_base64` (String) Content to store in the ZNode, as Base64 encoded bytes. Mutually exclusive with `data`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `path` (String) Absolute path to the Sequential ZNode, once it is created. The prefix of this will match `path_prefix`.
- `stat` (List of Object) [ZooKeeper Stat Structure](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkStatStructure) of the ZNode. More details about `stat` can be found [here](../../docs#the-stat-structure). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stat))

<a id="nestedblock--acl"></a>
### Nested Schema for `acl`

Required:

- `id` (String) The ID for the ACL entry. For example, user:hash in 'digest' scheme.
- `permissions` (Number) The permissions for the ACL entry, represented as an integer bitmask.
- `scheme` (String) The ACL scheme, such as 'world', 'digest', 'ip', 'x509'.


<a id="nestedatt--stat"></a>
### Nested Schema for `stat`

Read-Only:

- `aversion` (Number)
- `ctime` (Number)
- `cversion` (Number)
- `czxid` (Number)
- `data_length` (Number)
- `ephemeral_owner` (Number)
- `mtime` (Number)
- `mzxid` (Number)
- `num_children` (Number)
- `pzxid` (Number)
- `version` (Number)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import zookeeper_sequential_znode.from_dir /zookeeper/path/to/sequential_znode/0000000002
```
